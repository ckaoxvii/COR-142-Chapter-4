What can you say about the trend in the plot? Describe the relationship between the weight of the cars and their horsepower.\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot shows a positive trend because the graph increases from left to right.

What can you say about the trend in the plot? Describe the relationship between the weight of the cars and their mileage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot shows a negative trend because the graph decreases from left to right.

This data set shows an association between the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-variables, but it cannot be characterized as positive or negative. It is certainly ______.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the scatterplot shown below.

Compare the strength of the associations in these two plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a stronger association between waist size and weight (less vertical variation in the graph) than between height and weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 6.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nThe scatterplot below shows snout vent length (in) vs weight of alligators.

There seems to be a strong linear association between the miles traveled and fuel consumption. There is, however, an unusual data point that does not follow the trend. b. It could be a typographical error, or it could be an electric/hybrid vehicle. The scatterplot is reasonable if the vehicle is an electric or hybrid. c. If the outlier is removed, then the \\(r\\)-value will increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 10.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nBoth scatterplots below assess average miles per gallon fuel consumption for passenger cars. Both depict data from the sample of vehicles.\n\nWhat is the approximate average mpg for a car with a cab space of 120 cubic feet?\nWhat is the approximate average mpg for a car with a horsepower of 150?\nAre these associations positive, negative, or there is no trend?\nWhich do you think has a stronger relationship with average mileage–the car’s horsepower or the cab space? Why?\nIf you wanted to predict the average mileage for a car, would you be able to make a better prediction by knowing its horsepower or its cab space in cubic feet?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. Using the blue regression line as a guide, a car with 120 cubic feet of cab space has an average mileage of roughly 26 mpg. b. Using the red regression line as a guide, a car with a 150 horsepower has an average mileage of roughly 28 mpg. c. Both lines have negative slopes, so both associations are negative. d. The red line has a steeper slope, indicating that the association between horsepower and average mileage is stronger. e. Because the relationship between horsepower and average mileage is stronger, one can make better predictions of a car’s average mileage by knowing its horsepower rather than its cab space."
